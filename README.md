TODO:
- write readme explanation for model, code, structure, references
- fix comments (unnecessary and necessary additions, explanations at top for every file)
- check everything works (names, dependencies, later fixes, problems)
- no errors!
- exploratory code missing (existing discr, cont., and previous iGraph)
- plots?
- reproduce earlier results to check!
